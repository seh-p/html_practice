    <h3>Author Statement</h3>
    <p>"Writers should have the highest ambition: not just for themselves, but for the form they work in. Flaubert once
        rebuked Louise Colet for having the love of art yet lacking 'the religion of art': she fancied its rituals, the
        vestments and the incense, but did not finally believe in its revealed truths. I am a writer for an accumulation
        of lesser reasons (love of words, fear of death, hope of fame, delight in creation, distaste for office hours)
        and for one presiding major reason: because I believe that the best art tells the most truth about life. Listen
        to the competing lies: to the tatty rhetoric of politics, the false promises of religion, the contaminated
        voices of television and journalism. Whereas the novel tells the beautiful, shapely lies which enclose hard,
        exact truth. This is its paradox, its grandeur, its seductive dangerousness. Two famous deaths have been
        intermittently proclaimed for some time now: the death of God and the death of the novel. Both are exaggerated.
        And since God was one of the fictional impulse's earliest and finest creations, I'll bet on the novel - in
        however mutated a version - to outlast even God."</p>
